The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.
A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

> sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
> uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
> grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
> sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.


> git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
> git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
> git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.


The following commands are useful in the Git branch workflow.

> git branch: Lists all a Git project’s branches.
> git branch branch_name: Creates a new branch.
> git checkout branch_name: Used to switch from one branch to another.
> git merge branch_name: Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
> git branch -d branch_name: Deletes the branch specified.

> git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
> git remote -v: Lists a Git project’s remotes.
> git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
> git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
> git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
