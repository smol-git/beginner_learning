Bootstrap’s grid!

Let’s review some key concepts:

> When in doubt, check Bootstrap’s documentation.

> There are a few required links to use Bootstrap (the CSS file and two <meta> tags)

> Bootstrap 4 has a grid system implemented using flexbox

> The grid system is made of containers, rows, and columns that work together to make a web page’s layout.

> Containers are needed to implement the grid.

> Containers hold rows which hold columns.

> Bootstrap’s grid follows a 12 column system.

> Bootstrap uses responsive design and is built around breakpoints related to device screen sizes.

> To manually set the width of a column we have to follow Bootstrap’s naming convention.

> We can add multiple classes to a column to determine how wide a column should be on specific breakpoints.
